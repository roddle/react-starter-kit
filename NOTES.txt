### Deploying to Heroku
  - Example 1 and 2 from koistya https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/commit/63d4751cbe19ddfa42ee44767256ba4565e6244e#commitcomment-10840631

  - 'The only annoying thing is that all of your dependencies have to live under "dependencies" instead of having separate "devDependencies"'
    - what do i do here? make a temp package.json file for deploying to heroku? 

### Errors
  - iojs hangs on port 5000
    - use lsof -i :5000 to see what process is on 5000 (likely iojs)
    - kill that process!
    - look for how iojs handles error and close events
      - try adding lrServer.close() in these places

### Deploying to Heroku
  - probably need to run gulp build before starting the server

### pointing theHomie at heroku
  - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains
  - get my surfpage into this app STAT

### Commenting
  If I am going to specialize in orchestrating mashups as a service, I should start asap.
  - see the hypercomments-widget in NOTES folder
    - Maybe I should use this just on the articles I publish. 
    - as for customers I should build a way to allow paid customers to rate and comment on their experience with me

## SETUP
  - clone my repo & initialize
    - $ git clone URL
    - $ cd thisDIR
    - $ npm install
  - add upstream branch
    - $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit.git
    - $ git remote -v
  - get upstream code and merge into mine
    - $ git fetch upstream
    - (really this should merge to a staging branch and then to master)
    - $ git merge upstream/master
    - npm install


### adding the remote branch

### Updating from the remote branch
  - git fetch upstream            // get the code from the branch I forked from
  - git merge upstream/master     // merge this code with my local branch
    - this will open vim asking for a commit message
    - may be able to avoid this with git merge upstream/master -m 'merging latest from upstream'
  - git commit -m "merged latest from upstream"  // commit the changes just introduced to my branch
  - git checkout master           // set focus back on my branch
  - git push                      // send this branch up to my git repo
  - npm install                   // update all new node modules and dependencies
